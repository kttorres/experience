## Research Experience

### **Research Technician and Researcher at TAI - ESPOL**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | 2024 – Present*  
### **Research Technician and Researcher at TAI - ESPOL**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | Sept 2024 – Present*  
At **TAI - ESPOL**, I focus on the development of **prototypes** and **software** for advanced **research projects** in the **Smart Environments Technologies Lab**. My work is heavily centered around the **hardware design** and **development of printed circuit boards (PCBs)** and **embedded systems**. I am responsible for designing and testing hardware components, ensuring that they integrate seamlessly into the overall research systems.

I also oversee the **operation and maintenance** of **hardware prototyping equipment**, ensuring that all tools and devices are in optimal working condition to support ongoing experimental work. This is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the systems we develop.

In addition, I create **datasets** and develop **applications** using cutting-edge **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **TinyML** techniques. These solutions are applied to **machine learning** models that are used for real-time data processing and decision-making in **IoT systems**. I work closely with my team to design intelligent systems capable of adapting to dynamic environments.

I assist in preparing **research project proposals** and conduct **literature reviews**, helping to shape the direction of research within the group. This includes identifying gaps in existing knowledge and proposing innovative solutions to address those challenges. 

As part of my role, I also **direct projects** and **supervise prototyping** within a multidisciplinary team. This involves coordinating with various specialists, ensuring that project milestones are met, and that all work is aligned with the overall research objectives.

Finally, I actively contribute to the academic side of our projects by **authoring and publishing scientific articles**. I assist in the preparation and submission of papers to various **conferences** and **journals**, helping to communicate our research findings to the wider scientific community.

### **Research Assistant (Ad Honorem) - ESPOL**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | 2021 – 2023*  
As an **ad honorem research assistant** at **ESPOL**, I participated in several high-impact research projects focused on **robotics** and **autonomous navigation**. My work involved developing **intelligent control strategies** for **autonomous sailboats**, incorporating **TensorFlow**, **YOLO**, and **SLAM** to enable the boat to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles. I also worked on preparing research papers, contributing to the **IEEE Ibero-American Congress of Mechanical Engineering** where I presented a paper on autonomous sailboat navigation. This experience helped me refine my skills in **AI**, **machine learning**, and **robotics**, while also improving my ability to communicate complex technical concepts through research publications and conference presentations.

### **Mechatronic Design Assistant - Robotilsa S.A.**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | Feb 2022 – Jul 2022*  
At **Robotilsa S.A.**, I participated in mechatronic design projects where I collaborated in the development and testing of **robotic systems** for various industrial applications. My work focused on **system integration** and **mechanical design**, applying my skills in **AI** to optimize performance and enhance the functionality of robotic systems. I also worked on creating **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)** for **robotic systems** and **flexible manufacturing systems**, improving the efficiency and reliability of automated production lines. 


## Key Projects and Achievements

- **Autonomous Sailboat Navigation**: Developing a system for **unmanned autonomous vehicles** to navigate autonomously using **SLAM** and **obstacle detection** for sailboats using **AI**, **SLAM**, and **YOLO** for obstacle detection and autonomous movement.
  
- **Robotic Prosthesis Development**: Designed and implemented a **robotic prosthesis** using **myoelectric sensors** and **oximetry**, applying **AI** to interpret sensor data and control the prosthetic movement. This work was part of my thesis, where I utilized **reinforcement learning** to optimize the control of the prosthesis.
