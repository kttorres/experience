## Research Experience

### **Research Technician and Researcher at TAI - ESPOL**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | Sept 2024 – Present*  
At **TAI - ESPOL**, I work on advanced **autonomous systems** and **AI applications** in the **Smart Environments Technologies Lab**. My current research focuses on the application of **TinyML** techniques to **edge devices**, enabling real-time data processing for **IoT** systems. I am developing cutting-edge systems for autonomous navigation, using **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and **obstacle detection** techniques to enhance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and systems. As part of my work, I contribute to both the development of **robotic systems** and research papers, with a focus on **AI**-driven solutions for smart environments.

### **Research Assistant (Ad Honorem) - ESPOL**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | 2021 – 2023*  
As an **ad honorem research assistant** at **ESPOL**, I participated in several high-impact research projects focused on **robotics** and **autonomous navigation**. My work involved developing **intelligent control strategies** for **autonomous sailboats**, incorporating **TensorFlow**, **YOLO**, and **SLAM** to enable the boat to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles. I also worked on preparing research papers, contributing to the **IEEE Ibero-American Congress of Mechanical Engineering** where I presented a paper on autonomous sailboat navigation. This experience helped me refine my skills in **AI**, **machine learning**, and **robotics**, while also improving my ability to communicate complex technical concepts through research publications and conference presentations.

### **Mechatronic Design Assistant - Robotilsa S.A.**  
*Guayaquil, Ecuador | Feb 2022 – Jul 2022*  
At **Robotilsa S.A.**, I participated in mechatronic design projects where I collaborated in the development and testing of **robotic systems** for various industrial applications. My work focused on **system integration** and **mechanical design**, applying my skills in **AI** to optimize performance and enhance the functionality of robotic systems. I also worked on creating **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)** for **robotic systems** and **flexible manufacturing systems**, improving the efficiency and reliability of automated production lines. 


## Key Projects and Achievements

- **Autonomous Sailboat Navigation**: Developing a system for **unmanned autonomous vehicles** to navigate autonomously using **SLAM** and **obstacle detection** for sailboats using **AI**, **SLAM**, and **YOLO** for obstacle detection and autonomous movement.
  
- **Robotic Prosthesis Development**: Designed and implemented a **robotic prosthesis** using **myoelectric sensors** and **oximetry**, applying **AI** to interpret sensor data and control the prosthetic movement. This work was part of my thesis, where I utilized **reinforcement learning** to optimize the control of the prosthesis.
  
- **AI-Based Pneumonia Detection System**: Developed a **CNN**-based system for **pneumonia detection**, applying **deep learning** techniques to analyze medical data and provide accurate diagnosis.
  

### **Thesis: Robotic Prosthesis with EMG and Oximetry Sensors**
For my **thesis**, I developed a **robotic prosthesis** controlled by **EMG signals** (electromyographic signals) and **oximetry sensors**. The challenge was to train a **reinforcement learning** agent to interpret these signals and generate precise control commands for the prosthesis. The key steps included:
- Data collection: **EMG signals** were gathered and paired with the intended prosthetic movements.
- Signal processing: The raw **EMG signals** were filtered, normalized, and segmented into time windows.
- Reinforcement learning: Defined the **learning environment** where the agent (neural network) interacted with the prosthesis, using **reward functions** to guide learning.
- Evaluation: The agent was trained using **PPO**, **TRPO**, and **SAC** algorithms, achieving real-time control and precise manipulation of the prosthetic.

These projects, combined with my academic background and hands-on experience, have shaped my expertise in **robotics**, **AI**, and **TinyML**, allowing me to contribute to innovative solutions in autonomous systems, prosthetics, and AI-driven technologies.
