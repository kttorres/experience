As a **Robotics Teacher** at **EDUCAR** in Guayaquil during 2023, I had the opportunity to teach **robotics** to school and high school students. The focus of my classes was to engage students in **STEM** subjects through hands-on robotics projects, incorporating **artificial intelligence** and programming concepts to encourage critical thinking and creativity.

Using the **STEAM platform**, students worked on practical robotics projects that involved **programming** and **engineering** concepts. I guided them in building and programming robots, and we used **AI tools** to create interactive and motivating projects. In addition to teaching technical skills, I offered motivational talks to help students develop a passion for learning and to foster their engagement in STEM subjects.

Throughout the course, students gained both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in **AI**, **robotics**, and **programming**, preparing them to apply these skills in real-world applications. This role allowed me to not only teach but also inspire the next generation of engineers and innovators.
