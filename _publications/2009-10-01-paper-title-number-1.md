This paper titled **"Myoelectric Prosthesis Using Sensor Fusion Between Electromyography and Pulse Oximetry Signals"** was published in the **Journal Européen des Systèmes Automatisés** in **August 2023**. The research focuses on an innovative myoelectric prosthesis that integrates **electromyography (EMG)** and **pulse oximetry (PPG)** signals for controlling an upper limb prosthesis.

The model used for controlling the prosthesis achieved an impressive **93% accuracy** in predicting user movement intentions, based on **AI**-powered analysis of the bioelectric signals. This was implemented using an **ESP32 C3 DevKit-M1 development board** to create a low-cost, functional prosthetic solution.

The article also discusses the challenges and solutions related to the design and signal processing stages, including the fusion of **EMG** and **PPG** signals to enhance prosthetic control. The paper highlights the advantages of this approach, such as improved mobility and precision compared to traditional prosthetics.
