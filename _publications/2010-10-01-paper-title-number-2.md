This paper titled **"Autonomous Navigation for an Intelligent Sailboat - Sensailor"** was published as a **book chapter** in the proceedings of the **XV Ibero-American Congress of Mechanical Engineering**. The research focuses on developing an **autonomous navigation system** for the **Sensailor** intelligent sailboat, which integrates **Lidar** and **camera** sensors for obstacle recognition and navigation. The data collected from these sensors allow the sailboat to register obstacle coordinates and determine safe zones for navigation. AI algorithms are applied for path planning, ensuring the sailboat can move from its starting point to a target position while optimizing time and resources.
