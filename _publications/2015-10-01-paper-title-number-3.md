This paper titled **"Autonomous Navigation for an Intelligent Sailboat - Sensailor"** was presented at the **XV Ibero-American Congress of Mechanical Engineering (CIBIM 2022)** in **Madrid, Spain**. The research focuses on the development of an **autonomous navigation system** for the **Sensailor intelligent sailboat**. This system integrates **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), **Lidar**, and **camera data** for effective **obstacle avoidance** and **path planning**.

We presented the techniques used for **sensor fusion**, including the fusion of **Lidar point clouds** and **camera images**, to improve the navigation and **obstacle detection** capabilities of the sailboat. Additionally, we implemented algorithms for **trajectory planning** to allow the sailboat to autonomously navigate through predetermined waypoints, ensuring safe and efficient movement.
