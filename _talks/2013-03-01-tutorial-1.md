I had the honor of presenting my paper titled **"Modeling of Intelligent Control Strategies for an Autonomous Sailboat - Sensailor"** at the **IEEE 5th International Conference on Advanced Systems and Emergent Technologies (IC_ASET'2022)**. This conference, held in **Tunis**, brought together experts from across the globe to discuss **emergent technologies** and **advanced systems**.

During the presentation, I discussed the intelligent control strategies used for the **autonomous sailboat project Sensailor**, which integrates **AI**, **robotics**, and **autonomous navigation** techniques. This project involved modeling control systems for the boat to autonomously navigate while avoiding obstacles and optimizing its path.

It was a great opportunity to share insights into the intersection of **AI** and **autonomous systems**, as well as to engage with professionals and academics in the field of **robotics** and **emerging technologies**.
