I participated in the **IBM/IEEE AI Compute Symposium 2024 (AICS'24)** held at the **IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center** in **Yorktown Heights, NY**, USA. The symposium brought together leading experts, researchers, and students in the field of **artificial intelligence** to discuss **AI compute challenges** and future research directions.

I had the opportunity to present our **poster** on **TinyML** and its applications at the **edge**, which was **accepted** for presentation at the event. The symposium included notable invited speakers from **Johns Hopkins University**, **Meta**, **Nvidia**, **Intel**, **SK hynix**, **Samsung**, and **IBM Research**, covering topics such as **Chiplets**, **Generative AI Compute**, **Heterogeneous Integration**, **AI at the Edge**, and **Neuromorphic Architectures**.

The event also featured a **student poster session**, where the best student poster was awarded. The discussions around **TinyML** and **AI in IoT** were particularly insightful and aligned with my current research interests. This event was a fantastic opportunity to engage with innovators in **AI** and **AI hardware** ecosystems and contribute to the growing field of AI compute solutions.
