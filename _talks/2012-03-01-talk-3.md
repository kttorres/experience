I participated as a speaker at the **XV Ibero-American Congress of Mechanical Engineering (CIM 2022)**, held from **November 22-24, 2022**, at the **Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros Industriales**, **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid**, Spain. 

During this event, I presented my work titled **"Autonomous Navigation for an Intelligent Sailboat - Sensailor"**, where I discussed the integration of **autonomous navigation** systems for sailboats, focusing on **AI**, **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**, and **obstacle detection** techniques.

This conference brought together professionals and researchers in the field of **mechanical engineering**, and it was an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas and collaborate on advancing the application of **robotics** and **AI** in real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles.
